## Session 1
#### *How the Garden Grows*

Personae Dramatis
- [[Order of the Eel]]
- [[Fitz]]
- [[Grist]]
- [[Lord Rowan]]

##### The Job
[[Fitz]] approaches Pratchett about a simple swap job: replace a painting owned by Lord Rowan with a fake. 

##### The Pay
Fitz agrees to pay 6 coin for successfully delivering the real painting to him.

##### The Setup
**Casing the Manor**
- Oberon and Kai cased the manor from the outside, and learned that Lord Rowan employs ghosts to guard his home. They accidentally tipped off the guards that someone was watching the place, both otherwise escaped.
- Pratchett went to the Library to research the architecture of the Lord Rowan's manor, and discovered that there is an old sewer line the runs under the manor. 
- Pratchett sets up an initial infiltration of the manor, using sewer maintanence as a cover, so that they can find where the painting is located, and get a view of it in order to make a convincing fake. 
- Kai calls in a favor from Grist to help Pratchett's ruse, putting him further in debt with Grist. Grist has sailors place sign markers denoting city planning work being done along the street of Lord Rowan's manor.
- Pratchett, along with Sargasso, Clementine, and Dr. Oberon, get into the manor and are able to cofirm the sewer entrance to the manor, layout of the rooms, and get a good view of the painting. Kai refuses to come along.
- Sargasso knows over a set of armor, causing a disturbance that draws the attention of Lord Rowan. 
- Pratchett is able to successfully keep up the ruse with Lord Rowan and continue unimpeded.

**Creating a New Fake Painting**
- To avoid having to use Fitz's obvious forgery, Kai searches the city for a different forger, but it seems the only forger in the city currently is Fitz.
- After seeing the painting in the initial infiltration, Clementine is able to create a convinving forgery, but signs her name to the bottom, unbeknownst to the rest of the crew.

##### The Infiltration
- The crew infiltrates the manor through the sewer system. Kai has a panic attack from being stuck underground, and becomes quite stressed.
- They make their way into the manor, and Dr. Oberon looks into the ethereal plane and see the ghost guards patrolling the house. With Kai, they navigate to the gallery with the painting, barely avoiding the ghosts throughout. 
- Kai cut the painting out of the frame and replaced it with the fake. As they finished the task, a sound came from the door. Lord Rowan had come to the room and discovered them.
- Pratchett, with barely a word, stabs Lord Rowan, and the crew escapes back through the sewers. Kai barely makes it back to the shop, and passes out immediately upon return.
